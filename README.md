<hr>

### Special Methods:
  * **Fluent Python Reading**:
    * Part 1.1
    
  * **Additional Reading**:
    * [dbader.org dunder methods overview](https://dbader.org/blog/python-dunder-methods)
    * [farmdev.com special methods overview](http://farmdev.com/src/secrets/magicmethod/index.html)
    
  * **Notes About Reading**
    * From [Gianatcirolia](https://github.com/gianatcirolia): "This might be some informative examples maybe? I think especially for the sytax actually used when creating different     classes and their component functions!" 
    
  * **Programming Examples**:
    * `special_methods.ipynb`: Exploring __iter__() and __next__()

### Sequences: List Comprehension/Generator Expressions::
  * **Fluent Python Reading**:
    * Part 2.2
    
  * **Additional Reading**:
    * [Listcomp overview including performance testing](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-list-comprehensions-can-help-your-code-look-better-and-run-smoother-3cf8f87172ae)
    * [General overview of Genertor Expressions, includes good "why use"](https://towardsdatascience.com/pythons-list-generators-what-when-how-and-why-2a560abd3879)
    * [When not to use List Comprehension](https://hashnode.com/post/when-should-you-not-use-list-comprehensions-in-python-cj2a35qsh0020u9532z9e1n6z)
        
  * **Notes About Reading**
    * From [phoenixAja](https://github.com/phoenixAja): "towardsdatascience.com articles with good general overviews of listcomp and generator expressions, third article (or discussion thread) goes over when NOT to use listcomp, which I think is a crucial part of understanding list comp"

### Sequences: Bisect, Memory Views:
  * **Fluent Python Reading**:
    * Part 2.2
    
  * **Additional Reading**:
    * [Wikipedia Binary Search Algorithm]( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm)
    * [Python Docs for bisect](https://docs.python.org/3.0/library/bisect.html)
    * [Python Docs for Buffer Protocol](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/buffer.html)

  * **Notes About Reading**
    * From [phoenixAja](https://github.com/phoenixAja): "Start with learning the buffer protocol, and then understanding binary search algorithm to get a better grasp on this reading content."

### Sequences: Queues/Dequeues:
  * **Fluent Python Reading**:
    * Part 2.2
    
  * **Additional Reading**:
    * [Python docs, inlcudes small recipes for dequeues (mentioned in fluent python)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html)
    * [Why indexing should start at 0 (mentioned in fluent python)](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD831.html)  
        
  * **Notes About Reading**
    * From [phoenixAja](https://github.com/phoenixAja): "I put in the link for "why numbering should start at zero" from the fluent python extra reading because I thought it was interesting, and a maybe a good last antidote of the sequences chapter. "
